# Shopping Trends Analysis – Customer Behavior & Business Impact

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing shopping trends data to uncover real customer behavior patterns and translate them into actionable business insights.

Instead of focusing only on dashboards or visuals, this analysis answers one core question:

How can data drive better business decisions?

Using a dataset of 3,900 customers, I explored purchasing behavior, seasonality, product performance, and customer satisfaction to identify opportunities for revenue growth and improved customer engagement.

## Business Problem
Retail businesses often rely on assumptions when making decisions, such as:
- Women are always the main buyers
- Sales performance is similar across all seasons
- Customer satisfaction does not strongly impact revenue

This project challenges those assumptions using data to:
- Identify the most valuable customer segments
- Understand seasonal sales patterns
- Discover high performing product categories
- Highlight gaps in customer satisfaction

## Key Insights & Business Impact

### 1. Seasonal Sales Performance
Fall was identified as the highest performing sales season.
This insight shows that focusing promotions and marketing campaigns during the fall season can significantly increase overall revenue instead of spreading promotions evenly throughout the year.

---

### 2. Product Category Performance
Clothing emerged as the top product category, with pants being the most purchased item.
This supports better inventory planning and targeted marketing by prioritizing high-demand clothing items, especially pants, to maximize sales efficiency.

---

### 3. Customer Demographics Behavior
Contrary to common assumptions, the most active buyers were men aged between 40 and 60 years.
Targeted marketing strategies aimed at this demographic can improve conversion rates, while personalized offers may increase repeat purchases.

---

### 4. Customer Satisfaction Level
Overall customer satisfaction was moderate.
Moderate satisfaction suggests a risk of customer churn but also highlights an opportunity. Improving customer experience can increase loyalty, repeat purchases, and long-term revenue.

## Business Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:

- Increase promotional campaigns during the Fall season to maximize peak sales
- Strengthen marketing strategies aimed at female customers to grow.
- Improve customer experience to raise satisfaction levels and reduce churn.
